## Build and Run the Service using Docker

### Prerequisites

1. Ensure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your machine.
2. Ensure you have [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.

### 1. Clone the Repository

If you haven't already, clone the repository to your local machine.

### 2. Build the Docker Image

Navigate to the directory containing the `Dockerfile` and run:

```bash
docker build -t ems-image .
```

This will build a Docker image named `ems-image` from the `Dockerfile` in the current directory.

### 3. Run the Service using Docker

Navigate to the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` and run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Then give it a couple of minutes because MySQL might take a little while to be ready, especially on the first run when it's initializing data.

### 4. Access the Service

Then, the service will run on [`http://localhost:8080/ems`](http://localhost:8080/ems).

### Troubleshooting

- If you encounter port conflicts (e.g., port `8080` is already in use), either stop the service using the port or bind the application to a different port when running the Docker container.
- Ensure your Docker daemon is running before executing Docker commands.
- Check application logs in the Docker container for any issues related to the Spring Boot application.

## Unit Tests of the Service

### Run all unit tests

```bash
./mvnw test -Dcheckstyle.skip=true
```

If you want to generate a test coverage report, you can choose the following two commandsï¼š

#### Clean old build artifacts, run tests, and verify the package is correct.
```bash
./mvnw clean verify -Dcheckstyle.skip=true
```

#### Clean old build artifacts, run tests, create the package, and install it to the local Maven repository.

```bash
./mvnw clean install -Dcheckstyle.skip=true
```

Our unit tests have 98.6% code coverage. [Codecov report](https://app.codecov.io/gh/nehCG/ems)

## Integration Tests of the Service
We used Big Bang Integration Testing approach. We tested the integration of multiple units 
simultaneously, and the entire system is tested as a whole. 

### Internal Integration Test
For the internal integration test, we separately tested the interaction between Controller Layer and Service Layer and the interaction between Service layer and Repository layer. 
Then, the entire service integration is tested in the External Integration Test when testing RESTFul API.

### External Integration Test
Our application has two external components, which are RESTFul API and the MySQL database. Thus, we tested the 
interaction between the Mapper files and the external MySQL database. Next, we used @RestTemplate
to call each API endpoints, where the service is tested as a whole. 

## System Tests Corresponding to API
### System-level Tests of every API Entry Point
Please see details on below [API Documentation](#api-documentation) section.

### System-level Tests of Multiple Clients

We use the Runner in Postman to mock multiple clients are sending requests simultaneously.

We performed several API functional and performance tests that may face multiple clients requesting and high concurrency. You can check details [here](postman_API_tests/multiple_clients_testing).

## Persistent Data Storage of our Service

Based on the provided `docker-compose.yml`, the MySQL database container is set up to ensure data persistence
through Docker volumes. Specifically, the volumes directive under the mysql-db service maps db-data to `/var/lib/mysql`,
which is the default location where MySQL stores its data files. By doing so, any data changes made within the database
are stored in this Docker-managed volume, named `ems_db-data`. As a result, even if the MySQL container is stopped,
deleted, or recreated, the data remains intact and can be reattached to a new instance of the MySQL container.

This volume-driven approach guarantees the resilience and persistence of data across container lifecycle events,
ensuring that our database changes are consistently retained and not ephemeral.

In the course of our comprehensive System-level Testing for the Service, we rigorously executed all CRUD
(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations utilizing Postman as our primary testing interface. For each individual operation,
there was a direct and verifiable reflection in the MySQL database. This consistent alignment between the API calls and
the resulting database modifications unequivocally confirms the robust interaction and integration of our service layer
with the persistent data layer. Our meticulous testing approach ensures that our application not only responds to API
requests as expected but also effectively manages the underlying data in a reliable and consistent manner.
