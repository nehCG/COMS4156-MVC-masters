## Build and run the service using Docker

### Prerequisites

1. Ensure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your machine.
2. Ensure you have [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.

### 1. Clone the Repository

If you haven't already, clone the repository to your local machine.

### 2. Build the Docker Image

Navigate to the directory containing the `Dockerfile` and run:

```bash
docker build -t ems-image .
```

This will build a Docker image named `ems-image` from the `Dockerfile` in the current directory.

### 3. Run the Service using Docker

Navigate to the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` and run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Then give it a couple of minutes because MySQL might take a little while to be ready, especially on the first run when it's initializing data.

### 4. Access the Service

After a few minutes, open your browser and navigate to:

[http://localhost:8080/ems](http://localhost:8080/ems)

You should now see the service is running!

### Troubleshooting

- If you encounter port conflicts (e.g., port `8080` is already in use), either stop the service using the port or bind the application to a different port when running the Docker container.
- Ensure your Docker daemon is running before executing Docker commands.
- Check application logs in the Docker container for any issues related to the Spring Boot application.

## Test the service

### Run all unit tests

```bash
./mvnw test -Dcheckstyle.skip=true
```

If you want to generate a test coverage report, you can choose the following two commandsï¼š

#### Clean old build artifacts, run tests, and verify the package is correct.
```bash
./mvnw clean verify -Dcheckstyle.skip=true
```

#### Clean old build artifacts, run tests, create the package, and install it to the local Maven repository.

```bash
./mvnw clean install -Dcheckstyle.skip=true
```

## Style Checker

We use CheckStyle with Sun Checks

### Run Checkstyle

```bash
./mvnw checkstyle:check
```
